## Provides utilities for structuring and performing tests. However,
## the tests themselves need to be run by an external runner.

##
## Create a basic `test` object.
##
## The test is considered to have passed when `condition` evaluates to
## True. If `condition` evaluates to False, the test is considered to
## have failed.
##
## condition   : Test condition
## description : Description of the test
##
Test(condition, description) : {
    '(test)     -> self.type
    condition   -> self.condition
    description -> self.description
}

##
## Create a `test` object which is considered passed when `condition`
## evaluates to False.
##
## condition   : Test condition
## description : Description of the test
##
## Note: "Not" is prepended to the description.
##
Test-Not(condition, description) : {
    desc <- string-concat("Not ", description)

    Test(not(condition), desc)
}

##
## Create a `test` object with a condition which is true when `got` is
## equal, by `=` to `expected`.
##
## got         : The actual result obtained
## expected    : The expected result
## description : Description of the test
##
## Note: A string which prints the values for `got` and `expected is
## appended to the description.
##
Test-Equal(got, expected, description) : {
    full-description <-
        concat-strings(description, ": ", got, " = ", expected)

    Test(got = expected, full-description)
}


### Testing for Failures

##
## Create a `test` object with a condition which is true when `result`
## evaluates to a failure of type `type`.
##
## If `type` is omitted, the failure type is not checked.
##
## got         : The actual result obtained
## expected    : The expected result
## description : Description of the test
##
## Note: A string is appended to the description.
##
Test-Fails(result, description, :(type)) : {
    full-description <-
        concat-strings(description, " fails with type ", type)

    condition <-
        if(?(type),
           fail-type?(result, type),
           fails?(result))

    Test(condition, full-description)
}

##
## Create a `test` object with a condition which is true when `result`
## doe not evaluates to a failure of type `type`.
##
## If `type` is omitted, the failure type is not checked.
##
## got         : The actual result obtained
## expected    : The expected result
## description : Description of the test
##
## Note: A string is appended to the description.
##
Test-Not-Fails(result, description, :(type)) : {
    full-description <-
        concat-strings(description, " does not fail with type ", type)

    condition <-
        if(?(type),
           fail-type?(result, type),
           fails?(result))

    Test-Not(condition, full-description)
}


### Structuring Tests

##
## Group multiple tests into a single test.
##
## description : Description of the test group
## ..(tests)   : The tests
##
Test-Group(description, ..(tests)) : {
    '(group)    -> self.type
    tests       -> self.tests
    description -> self.description
}


### Utilities

##
## Converts a value to a string.
##
## If the value cannot be converted to a string, or evaluates to a
## failure, the string "<FAIL>" is returned.
##
## value: The value to convert.
##
value->string(value) : {
    string(value) -> @(self)
    "<FAIL>" -> @(self)
}

##
## Concatenates each value in `values` into a single string.
##
## Each value is converted to a string by `value->string`
##
## values: List of values.
##
concat-strings(..(values)) : {
    iter(values) : {
        first <- value->string(head(values))
        rest <- tail(values)

        if (values = Empty,
            "",
            string-concat(first, iter(rest)))
    }

    iter(values)
}
