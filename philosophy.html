<h2 id="_the_state_management_problem">The State Management Problem</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Most programming languages provide few tools for managing the state of
an application. In general it is up to the programmer to establish
listeners for important events or user interactions and manually
update the state of the application by modifying memory directly. This
is known as imperative programming. There is no way to specify the
application state as a set of a components, the states of which, are a
function of the states of other components.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Manually tracking and updating the state of the application is tedious
as it requires a lot of boilerplate code to be written to listen for
changes in the states of various application objects and update the
states of all objects whose state depends on those objects.  This
boilerplate code often can not be abstracted away and has to be
rewritten for each application. Furthermore, the application logic is
not contained in a central location but is rather dispersed throughout
various event listeners. Changes to the application logic require
changes in multiple event listeners, which can introduce subtle bugs
if the application logic is not implemented correctly across all event
listeners. As a result the core application logic is inflexible and
difficult to change once it has been written.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The problem is magnified when concurrency is involved. Consider that
the state of the user interface needs to be updated in response to an
event, such as the arrival of data from the network, however the state
of the user interface may only be updated from a specific <em>main</em>
thread whereas the event is delivered on a <em>background</em> thread
(different from the <em>main</em> thread). Suddenly inter-thread (and
sometimes even inter-process) synchronization logic has to be
intermixed with the application logic. The net result is that the
application logic is obscured in layers of event listener and
synchronization code.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_partial_solutions">Partial Solutions</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some toolkits or frameworks provide functionality for binding various
UI elements to application objects, such that when the state of the UI
element changes, the state of the application object is automatically
updated, without having to write additional code. However, these
bindings are usually very limited, as they only support trivial
bindings which only allow the value of the application object to be
automatically updated to match the value stored in the UI element or
vice versa. As an example of a trivial binding, consider a text field
bound to an an application object <span class="monospaced">X</span>, when the user enters text in
the text field <span class="monospaced">X</span> is automatically set to the value stored in the
text field. The binding is unconditional, meaning it is not possible
to specify under which conditions the state of the application object
should be automatically updated and under which conditions it should
not. Arbitrary functions are usually not supported, that is it is not
possible to specify, for example, that the state of an application
object <span class="monospaced">Sum</span> is bound to the sum of the values of two text fields <span class="monospaced">A</span>
and <span class="monospaced">B</span>. The result is that programmers often forgo using bindings, in
favor of imperative state management, due to these limitations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some toolkits may provide support for bindings involving more complex
functions, often known as <em>value transformers</em> or <em>formatters</em>.
However, these generally have to be specified in a different language,
separate from the language in which the bindings are specified,
usually requiring that a subclass or some <em>value transformer</em>
interface is implemented, which complicates the matter. Moreover,
these are usually still limited to a function of a single argument,
that is the state of the component can only be bound to a maximum of
one other component, meaning the <span class="monospaced">Sum</span> example cannot be implemented
without resorting to lower-level imperative state management.</p></div>

<h2 id="_the_tridash_solution">The Tridash Solution</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In Tridash an application is decomposed into a set of separate
components, called nodes, which can correspond to UI elements, other
stateful components, such as the filesystem, operating system or
network, or simply computational components. Each node has a
particular value, at a given moment in time, which comprises the
node&#8217;s state. The value (state) of each node can be specified as an
arbitrary function of the values (states) of an arbitrary number of
other nodes. This is unlike most toolkits/frameworks, which claim to
support bindings, that only allow a simple binding to a single other
node to be established. Bindings involving arbitrary functions can be
specified, and even new functions can be written, entirely using
Tridash without having to drop-down to a lower-level language. The aim
is that, using Tridash, the entire application state can be specified
as a set of nodes where the state of each node is a function of other
nodes.</p></div>
